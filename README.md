# Countdown-timer

This is another fairly simple application, but nevertheless, building it provided me lot of usefull practice.
Array.from, forEach, Array.some, Math.trunc, padStart, setInterval, clearInterval, style.pointerEvents, template literals...are few of the methods and features
used to create this project.

HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS
